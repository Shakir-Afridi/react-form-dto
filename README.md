# React Form DTO

A **dynamic, DTO-driven form builder** built with **React, TypeScript, and Material UI (MUI v6)**.  
This library lets you define forms declaratively using JSON DTOs (`FormDTO`, `SectionDTO`, `FieldDTO`) and automatically renders responsive, accessible forms with MUI components.

---

## ✨ Features

- **DTO-driven**: Define forms entirely in JSON/TypeScript objects.
- **Material UI integration**: Uses MUI v7 components for consistent design and accessibility.
- **Responsive grid layout**: 12-column system mapped to MUI’s `Grid` with `size` props.
- **Conditional rendering**: Show/hide fields or sections based on other field values.
- **Custom renderers**: Override default MUI inputs with your own components.
- **TypeScript support**: Strongly typed DTOs for safety and autocompletion.
- **Composable architecture**: `FormBuilder`, `Section`, and `Field` components.
